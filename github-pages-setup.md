# GitHub Pages Setup for Le Social Website

## Prerequisites

Before I can deploy the Le Social website to GitHub Pages, you need to set up GitHub credentials:

### 1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Navigate to: **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**
3. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
4. Give it a descriptive name: `Le Social Deployment`
5. Select the scope: **`public_repo`** (this allows access to public repositories)
6. Click **"Generate token"**
7. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't be able to see it again)

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Run these commands in the terminal, replacing with your actual values:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token_here"
export GH_USER="your_github_username"
```

### 3. Verify Setup

Once you've set the environment variables, I can verify the setup and proceed with:

1. Creating a new GitHub repository called `le-social-preview`
2. Pushing the optimized website code
3. Configuring GitHub Pages
4. Providing you with the live preview URL
